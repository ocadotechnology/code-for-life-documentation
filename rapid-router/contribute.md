## To contribute
__Found a problem? Please check whether it has already been reported in our [issue tracker][issues] first!__ If not,
[add it][add-issue]. Please make sure that you give us a suitable level of detail about the symptoms and how to
reproduce it. Please label it as a "bug".

__Want to suggest a feature? Please check whether it has already been added to our [issue tracker][issues] first!__ if
not, [add it][add-issue]. Please make sure that you give us a suitable level of detail about the feature. Please label
it as a "suggestion". Please note that we may not act upon all suggestions, if they are not in line with the direction
we want to take the project, or if we don't have the development resources to get it done.

__Want to help develop?__ Check out the [issue tracker][issues] for the tasks we'd like to implement. The
[issues with the 'ready for pickup' label][ready-for-pickup] are tasks we think are ready to be picked up. Once you have
chosen an issue, make sure you assign it to yourself so others don't also pick it up. Develop it on your fork of the
project. Please ensure all files have the license at the top (see another source file for an example). Once you are
happy that it works, and have written tests for it, submit a pull request. We'll then look to review the changes. If it
looks good, we'll merge it. If we find issues with it, we'll let you know and hopefully we can work with you to improve
it and get it re-submitted. If it is a change that we just don't want, we'll reject it.
