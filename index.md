# Code For Life

[Ocado Technology's](http://www.ocadotechnology.com/) Code for Life initiative has been developed to help teachers deliver the new curriculum, so they can inspire the next generation of computer scientists. 
But this is just the beginning. Over the next couple of years, this initiative will be expanded to support pupils throughout their school career, from age five to 16, and beyond.
