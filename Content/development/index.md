There are three main areas that need development in Code for life, and each has its own repository on Github:

* the **Code for life portal** - [https://github.com/ocadotechnology/codeforlife-portal](https://github.com/ocadotechnology/codeforlife-portal)
* the first Code for life game, **Rapid Router** - [https://github.com/ocadotechnology/rapid-router](https://github.com/ocadotechnology/rapid-router)
* the new Code for life game for teenagers, **AI:MMO** - [https://github.com/ocadotechnology/aimmo](https://github.com/ocadotechnology/aimmo)

This section explains what each of these projects are, how to get up and running with each one, and how you can contribute to the code.
