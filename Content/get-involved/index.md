So you're interested in getting involved with Code For life. This is a great place to start.

Code for Life needs volunteers to:

* work on our backlog and develop our products, like Rapid Router
* introduce new ideas
* help spread the word about Code for Life, in communities and schools

We want to make Code for Life the number one educational computing platform in the world. Think you can help?

First, visit [codeforlife.education](https://www.codeforlife.education/) to get familiar with Code for Life and Rapid Router, then read this page to find out how you can start contributing to the project.

## Meetups

Code for Life meet every Wednesday, in Titan Court, from 5pm.

The meetups provide a great opportunity to work on the project and get to know other Code for Life volunteers.

<br>
**Get involved in the meetups**

Everyone is welcome. The best way to get involved in the meetups is to:

1. Ask [Celine Boudier](mailto:celineboudier@ocado.com) to invite you to the event.

	You will receive a calendar invitation.

2. Accept the invite to let everyone know you're going.

<br>
**Feeling peckish?**

The Code for Life meetups usually involve a takeway, which is paid for by Ocado.

If you're coming to the meetup:

1. Let everyone know whether you're staying for dinner, by responding to the Slack reminder with a tick or a cross.

	The reminder is sent out on Wednesday mornings on the [#code-for-life](https://ocado.slack.com/messages/code-for-life/) Slack channel.

	![Slack reminder](/img/slack-reminder.png)

2. Everyone staying for dinner chooses a restaurant on the Slack channel. Make sure you have your say!

3. Add your order to the the [dinner spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12G57Z_q_k7yn5fYSbYkKQHiEtqDA1ngJQApvgNBuR-g/edit#gid=2127646728), in the tab with today's date.

	If you're a regular, you can also add you favourite food to the [default options]() tab, incase you ever forget to order in time.

4. Enjoy the meetup, and your food!

<br>
**After the session**

Anyone who contributes to Code for Life must fill out the [Volunteer hours form](https://docs.google.com/a/ocado.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSemNZtEitF13uja4-GmpKHZocQcm6Q-h-tTm6jvmXvTOY8Sww/viewform?c=0&w=1), to record the amount of time they have spent on the project.

Don't worry if you forget - a reminder is sent out on slack every Thursday morning.
